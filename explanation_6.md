In this problem, first I have created a set for making union & intersection of the two linked list. Then I have created a new linked list from the set.

### Union: 
- Time complexity: O(n) for lookup and store, 
- Space complexity: O(n)

### intersection: 
- Time complexity: O(n) for both look up and store, 
- Space complexity: O(n)
